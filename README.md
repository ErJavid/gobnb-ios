# gobnb-ios

gobnb uses Binance DEX to send BEP-2 token transactions to participating retailers using the QR code. 
It's an iOS app that integrates with MySQL back-end to fetch restaurant and menu data, once a user picks an item, the app allows near instant token payments into the retailer's wallet.

Just download or clone the app, open in XCode 10.2.1 and Swift 5 and above.

The app was iniitally built as a part of ETHNewYork 2019 hackathon. It has been renamed. Original project submission can be found here: [https://github.com/hammadtq/BinancePay](https://github.com/hammadtq/BinancePay)
